# Get started with Blazor and Razor Components

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/razor-components-preview-notice.md)]

## Setup

Install the following:

1. [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873092) (2.1.500 or later).
1. [Visual Studio 2017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873093) (15.9 or later) with the *ASP.NET and web development* workload selected.
1. The latest [Blazor Language Services extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870389) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
1. The Blazor templates on the command-line:

   ```console
   dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates
   ```

To create your first project from Visual Studio:

1. Select **File** > **New Project** > **Web** > **ASP.NET Core Web Application**.
1. Make sure **.NET Core** and **ASP.NET Core 2.1** are selected at the top.
1. Choose the Blazor template and select **OK**.

1. Press **Ctrl-F5** to run the app *without the debugger*. Running with the debugger (**F5**) isn't supported at this time.

To create a new Blazor app from the command-line:

```console
dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp1
cd BlazorApp1
dotnet run
```

Congrats! You just ran your first Blazor app!
