[View or download sample code](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor.Docs/tree/master/docs/components/common/samples/) ([how to download](xref:client-side/blazor/index#view-and-download-samples)). See the [Get started](xref:client-side/blazor/get-started) topic for prerequisites.

Blazor apps are built using *components*. A component is a self-contained chunk of user interface (UI), such as a page, dialog, or form. A component includes both the HTML markup to render along with the processing logic needed to inject data or respond to UI events. Components are flexible and lightweight, and they can be nested, reused, and shared between projects.

## Component classes

Blazor components are typically implemented in *\*.cshtml* files using a combination of C# and HTML markup. The UI for a component is defined using HTML. Dynamic rendering logic (for example, loops, conditionals, expressions) is added using an embedded C# syntax called [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor). When a Blazor app is compiled, the HTML markup and C# rendering logic are converted into a component class. The name of the generated class matches the name of the file.

Members of the component class are defined in a `@functions` block (more than one `@functions` block is permissible). In the `@functions` block, component state (properties, fields) is specified along with methods for event handling or for defining other component logic.

Component members can then be used as part of the component's rendering logic using C# expressions that start with `@`. For example, a C# field is rendered by prefixing `@` to the field name. The following example evaluates and renders:

* `_headingFontStyle` to the CSS property value for `font-style`.
* `_headingText` to the content of the `<h1>` element.

```cshtml
<h1 style="font-style:@_headingFontStyle">@_headingText</h1>

@functions {
    private string _headingFontStyle = "italic";
    private string _headingText = "Put on your new Blazor!";
}
```

After the component is initially rendered, the component regenerates its render tree in response to events. Blazor then compares the new render tree against the previous one and applies any modifications to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).

## Using components

Components can include other components by declaring them using HTML element syntax. The markup for using a component looks like an HTML tag where the name of the tag is the component type.

The following markup renders a `HeadingComponent` (*HeadingComponent.cshtml*) instance:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/Index.cshtml?start=11&end=11)]

## Component parameters

Components can have *component parameters*, which are defined using public properties on the component class. Use attributes to specify arguments for a component in markup.

In the following example, the `ParentComponent` sets the value of the `Title` property of the `ChildComponent`:

*ParentComponent.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/ParentComponent.cshtml?start=1&end=7&highlight=5)]

*ChildComponent.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/ChildComponent.cshtml?highlight=7)]

## Child content

Components can set the content of an element in another component by assigning to a property that represents a [RenderFragment](/api/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.RenderFragment.html) type.

In the following example, the `ChildContent` element of the `ParentComponent` sets the value of the `ChildComponent`'s `PanelContent` property. `PanelContent` is a `RenderFragment` type and supplies the content to the Bootstrap panel.

*ParentComponent.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/ParentComponent.cshtml?start=1&end=7&highlight=6)]

*ChildComponent.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/ChildComponent.cshtml?highlight=3,8)]

## Data binding

Data binding to both components and DOM elements is accomplished with the `bind` attribute. The following example binds the `ItalicsCheck` property to the check box's checked state:

```cshtml
<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="italicsCheck" bind="@_italicsCheck" />
```

When the check box is selected and cleared, the property's value is updated to `true` and `false`, respectively.

The check box is updated in the UI only when the component is rendered, not in response to changing the property's value. Since components render themselves after event handler code executes, property updates are usually reflected in the UI immediately.

Using `bind` with a `CurrentValue` property (`<input bind="@CurrentValue" />`) is essentially equivalent to the following:

```cshtml
<input value="@CurrentValue" 
    onchange="@((UIValueEventArgs __e) => CurrentValue = __e.Value) />
```

When the component is rendered, the `value` of the input element comes from the `CurrentValue` property. When the user types in the text box, the `onchange` is fired and the `CurrentValue` property is set to the changed value. In reality, the code generation is a little more complex because `bind` deals with a few cases where type conversions are performed. In principle, `bind` associates the current value of an expression with a `value` attribute and handles changes using the registered handler.

**Format strings**

Data binding works with [DateTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.datetime) format strings (but not other format expressions at this time, such as currency or number formats):

```cshtml
<input bind="@StartDate" format-value="yyyy-MM-dd" />

@functions {
    public DateTime StartDate { get; set; } = new DateTime(2020, 1, 1);
}
```

**Component attributes**

Binding also recognizes component attributes, where `bind-{property}` can bind a property value across components.

The following parent component uses `ChildComponent` and binds the value `1979` from `ParentYear` to the child component's `Year` property:

Parent component:

```cshtml
<ChildComponent bind-Year="@ParentYear" />

@functions {
    public int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1979;
}
```

Child component:

```cshtml
<div> ... </div>

@functions {
    public int Year { get; set; }
    public Action<int> ValueChanged { get; set; }
}
```

## Event handling

Blazor provides event handling features. For an HTML element attribute named `on<event>` (for example, `onclick`, `onsubmit`) with a delegate-typed value, Blazor treats the attribute's value as an event handler. The attribute's name always starts with `on`.

The following code calls the `UpdateHeading` method when the button is selected in the UI:

```cshtml
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="@UpdateHeading">
    Update heading
</button>

@functions {
    void UpdateHeading(UIMouseEventArgs e)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

The following code calls the `CheckboxChanged` method when the check box is changed in the UI:

```cshtml
<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" onchange="@CheckboxChanged" />

@functions {
    void CheckboxChanged()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

For some events, event-specific event argument types are permitted. If access to one of these event types isn't necessary, it isn't required in the method call.

The list of supported event arguments is:

* UIEventArgs
* UIChangeEventArgs
* UIKeyboardEventArgs
* UIMouseEventArgs

Lambda expressions can also be used:

```cshtml
<button onclick="@(e => Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!"))">Say hello</button>
```

## Lifecycle methods

`OnInitAsync` and `OnInit` execute code after the component has been initialized. To perform an asynchronous operation, use `OnInitAsync` and use the `await` keyword:

```csharp
protected override async Task OnInitAsync()
{
    await ...
}
```

For a synchronous operation, use `OnInit`:

```csharp
protected override void OnInit()
{
    ...
}
```

`OnParametersSetAsync` and `OnParametersSet` are called when a component has received parameters from its parent and the values are assigned to properties. These methods are executed after `OnInit` during component initialization.

```csharp
protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
{
    await ...
}
```

```csharp
protected override void OnParametersSet()
{
    ...
}
```

`SetParameters` can be overridden to execute code before parameters are set:

```csharp
public override void SetParameters(ParameterCollection parameters)
{
    ...

    base.SetParameters(parameters);
}
```

If `base.SetParameters` isn't invoked, the custom code can interpret the incoming parameters value in any way required. For example, the incoming parameters aren't required to be assigned to the properties on the class.

`ShouldRender` can be overridden to suppress refreshing of the UI. If the implementation returns `true`, the UI is refreshed. Even if `ShouldRender` is overridden, the component is always initially rendered.

```csharp
protected override bool ShouldRender()
{
    var renderUI = true;

    return renderUI;
}
```

## Component disposal with IDisposable

If a component implements [IDisposable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.idisposable), the [Dispose method](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose) is called when the component is removed from the UI. The following component uses `@implements IDisposable` and the `Dispose` method:

```csharp
@using System
@implements IDisposable

...

@functions {
    public void Dispose()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Routing

Routing in Blazor is achieved by providing a route template to each accessible component in the app.

When a *\*.cshtml* file with an `@page` directive is compiled, the generated class is given a [RouteAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.routeattribute) specifying the route template. At runtime, the router looks for component classes with a `RouteAttribute` and renders whichever component has a route template that matches the requested URL.

Multiple route templates can be applied to a component. The following component responds to requests for `/BlazorRoute` and `/DifferentBlazorRoute`:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/BlazorRoute.cshtml?start=1&end=4)]

## Route parameters

Blazor components can receive route parameters from the route template provided in the `@page` directive. The Blazor client-side router uses route parameters to populate the corresponding component parameters.

*RouteParameter.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/RouteParameter.cshtml?start=1&end=8)]

Optional parameters aren't supported, so two `@page` directives are applied in the example above. The first permits navigation to the component without a parameter. The second `@page` directive takes the `{text}` route parameter and assigns the value to the `Text` property.

## JavaScript/TypeScript interop

To call JavaScript libraries or custom JavaScript/TypeScript code from .NET, the current approach is to register a named function with JavaScript/TypeScript. Place the `registerFunction` call in the *index.html* file or a JavaScript file (*\*.js*) loaded by the *index.html* file. Place the inline JavaScript or `<script>` tag below `<script type="blazor-boot"></script>`, and the JavaScript/TypeScript loads at the correct time and only executes once. 

```javascript
Blazor.registerFunction('doPrompt', function(message) {
    return prompt(message);
});
```

Wrap the named function for calls from .NET:

```csharp
public static bool DoPrompt(string message)
{
    return RegisteredFunction.Invoke<bool>("doPrompt", message);
}
```

This approach has the benefit of working with JavaScript build tools, such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The Mono team is working on a library that exposes standard browser APIs to .NET.

## Base class inheritance for a "code-behind" experience

Blazor's Razor files (*\*.cshtml*) mix HTML markup and C# processing code in the same file. The `@inherits` directive can be used to provide Blazor with a "code-behind" experience that separates component markup from processing code.

The [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor.Docs/tree/master/docs/components/common/samples/) shows how a component can inherit a base class, `BlazorRocksBase`, to provide the component's properties and methods.

*BlazorRocks.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/BlazorRocks.cshtml?start=1&end=8)]

*BlazorRocksBase.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](common/samples/2.x/ComponentsSample/Pages/BlazorRocksBase.cs)]

The base class must derive from [BlazorComponent](/api/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Components.BlazorComponent.html).

## Razor support

**Razor directives**

Razor directives active with Blazor apps are shown in the following table.

| Directive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [@functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor#functions) | Adds a C# code block to a component. |
| `@implements` | Implements an interface for the generated component class. Often used to create a component layout by implementing `ILayoutComponent`. |
| [@inherits](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor#inherits) | Provides full control of the class that the component inherits. |
| [@inject](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor#inject) | Enables service injection from the [service container](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection). For more information, see [Dependency injection into views](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/dependency-injection). |
| `@layout` | Specifies a layout component. Layout components are used to avoid code duplication and inconsistency. |
| [@page](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages#razor-pages) | Specifies that the component should handle requests directly. The `@page` directive can be specified with a route and optional parameters. Unlike Razor Pages, the `@page` directive doesn't need to be the first directive at the top of the file. |
| [@using](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor#using) | Adds the C# `using` directive to the generated component class. |
| [@addTagHelper](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor#tag-helpers) | Use `@addTagHelper` to use a component in a different assembly than the app's assembly. |

**Conditional attributes**

Blazor conditionally renders attributes based on the .NET value. If the value is `false` or `null`, Blazor won't render the attribute. If the value is `true`, the attribute is rendered minimized.

In the following example, `IsCompleted` determines if `checked` is rendered in the control's markup.

```cshtml
<input type="checkbox" checked="@IsCompleted" />

@functions {
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
}
```

If `IsCompleted` is `true`, the check box is rendered as:

```html
<input type="checkbox" checked />
```

If `IsCompleted` is `false`, the check box is rendered as:

```html
<input type="checkbox" />
```

**Additional information on Razor**

For more information on Razor, see the [Razor syntax reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor). Note that not all of the features of Razor are available in Blazor at this time.
